# Style

## Indentation and Spacing / Horizontal Spacing
Always use 4 space tabbing. (i.e. not `\t` character)  
Keep spacing around operators

```python
sum = a + b  # good
sum=a+b      # bad
```
Limit line length to be < 80 characters

## Vertical Spacing
Use blank lines to separate logical blocks
```python
def foo():
  validation_user_input()
  process_authentication()

  initialize()
  other_thing()
```
It is preferred to use vertical separators sparingly, having single lines of code isolated
vertically is not preferred.


## Commas and quotes
Always use trailing commas (results in consistent git merging behavior)

```python
data = {
    "key": 5,
    "key2": 4, # <-- this one
}
```

For quotations always use double quotes: `"`  
Inner single quotes `'` are acceptable
```python
"This is a string" # ok
"This is a 'string'" # inner ' is acceptable
dict["key"] # even in dictionary key accessing " is used
```
